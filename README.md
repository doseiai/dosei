## The infrastructure runtime for Developers

The open-source [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) successor. Google Cloud Run and other container orchestration services are awesome. It has made Developers work massively easier when we compare it
to operating a Kubernetes Cluster. However, most services are either non-portable (aka. "proprietary") or built on top of K8S, which makes it hard to test and operate applications infrastructure, specially locally.

That's where Dosei comes in! Self-hosted, IaC and local development first experience.

#### Key Features

- **Fast**: ðŸ¦€ [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is blazingly fast and Dosei is built on top of it!
- **Language agnostic IaC**: We officially support SDKS in [Python](https://github.com/doseiai/python-sdk) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/doseiai/javascript-sdk)
- **Local first**: Build, test and run your infrastructure locally!
- [Cron Jobs](https://dosei.ai/docs/cron-jobs): Locally testable, versioned and scalable Cron Jobs! 

At it's core Dosei is really an infrastructure runtime for Developers
